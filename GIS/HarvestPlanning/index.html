                                    <p style="font-size: 18px;">Forest managers must ensure that forest operations do nut disrupt ecosystemes
                                    	or habitats of mammals or similar forest-dwelling beings, especially if they are classified as <em>Endangered</em> or <em>Threatened</em>. This normally means that careful planning that considers the presence of threatened or endangered species is always a necessity in forestry activities such as timber logging or harvesting. Indeed several provincial and federal conservation regulations enjoin
                                    	forest and natural resource nmanagers to make adequate provisions in their management plans to protect ecosystems and habitats of such species during operations such as timber logging. In Northern-Interior BC, one such species that is constantly threatened by logging activities is the <em>Myotis Lucifugus</em>, commonly called the <strong>Little Brown Bat</strong>. (For more on this particular species, check out this <a href="GIS/myotis_lucifugus.pdf">handout</a>). In this project, I explore options for conserving <em>myotis lucifugus</em> habitat during a logging operation in the Prince George-Mackenzie-Peace River Forest districts in BC. Some of the main considerations were:<br>
                                            <ol>
                                                <li>What Biogeoclimatic Zone types are Little Brown Bats mostly found in?</li>
                                                <li>What proportion of Little Brown Bats are present in each BEC zone?</li>
                                                <li>How much forest area is non-loggable as a result of the presence of Little Brown Bats?</li>

This was intended to help provide a thorough understanding of user needs, and how to meet them via the new system's products and services (Coronel & Morris, 2016). The business rules for the new database were defined as follows:

                                    <p>The interactions and processes defined in the business rules were used to develop an Entity Relations Model shown above. To eliminate any data duplication and redundancies in the tables created above, I implemented a series of normalization. Coronel & Morris (2016) posit that a Second Normal Form (2NF) occurs when a database table is already in a First Normal Form (1NF) and includes no partial dependencies. In other words, none of the table's attributes are dependent on a portion of the primary key. Similarly, a Third Normal Form (3NF) is reached when a table is already in Second Normal Form (2NF) and contains no transitive dependencies. Following these recommendations, I ensured that all non-key attributes of tables were dependent on their primary keys, and that all tables had single key values with none of them repeating or duplicated. This is depicted in the diagram below:</p><br><br>

                                    <p>Having completed the logical aspect of the design process, it was now time to bring the database application to life. To do this, I used <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/sql-server/sql-server-2012-sp4-release-notes?view=sql-server-2016">Microsoft SQL Server</a> version 12 for Windows Operating System. I used this particular tool/software primarily because it is free, has an intuitive interface and a relatively shallow learning curve . To input the necessary commands for creating the database, I wrote a <a href="OLA_LogicalDesign.sql">script</a> using  Stuctured Query Language (SQL). </p><p>To ascertain how well the new database met the requirements and objectives outlined breviously, I wrote several SQL queries to test for robustness and capacity to handle complex tasks. A few of these queries are illustrated below:</p><br><br>

                            <p>As indicated in the above query, various columns were referenced in two tables: PATRON - given an alias p - and REQUEST - assigned an alias r.

                        <p>As shown in the results of the second test scenario, the SQL clause, UNION, was used to combine the results of two SELECT statements from two separate tables - BOOK and JOURNAL_ITEM - into a single result set made up of all the rows affected by the SELECT statements. </p>
                        <p>From the successful execution of the two test queries therefore, it was clear that the new database was well equipped to handle complex and advanced inter library lending query tasks.</p>

                                    <p>A relational database for handling interlibrary lending transactions may entail more complexity and detail than what is depicted in this project. The prudence of decentralizing interlending services, especially in large post secondary institutions, is also a subject of intense debate. Indeed, there are some who argue strongly for decentralizing such systems and feel that their costs can be lowered by automation (Vervliet, 1981). These are quite interesting and important debates, and given my enthusiasm about systems librarianship, I plan to continue developing more skills and knowledge about how database systems and technologies may be designed and implemented to help libraries pull resources together, save cost, and improve effieciency of service delivery.</p>
                                    <p>I am currently developing a front-end web application to connect to this project and improve its accessibility. I'm also looking into building a viable database product, perhaps for a non-profit organization or a similar entity committed to improving literacy access for marginalized communities.</p>
